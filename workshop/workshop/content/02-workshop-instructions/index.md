To build a "on demand" enviroment, that just works, a lot of automations needed.

Luckely Educates has many options to make this happen.

In our Workshop folder, we have a subfolder **setup.d** with the shell file **setup-resources.sh**

This file is run, every time a new workshop starts.

In our case, it creates the readme.md file, in our exercises folder.

Let's see what it contains.

```execute-2
cat readme.md
```
